---

## üîí Security Considerations

### What's Safe:
- All demos run client-side (no server-side password handling)
- No real passwords are logged, stored, or transmitted
- CTF flags are obviously fake (`CTF{...}` format)
- Wordlist is intentionally tiny (22 words) for educational purposes
- All pages include prominent security warnings

### What's Intentionally Vulnerable (for education):
- `/api-demo` - Shows insecure query parameter authentication
- `/ctf-example` - Contains intentionally hidden flags
- `/crack-sha256` - Demonstrates dictionary attacks (limited scope)
- `/netsec-login` - Shows plaintext transmission risks

### Warnings Included:
- "Educational Demo Only - Do Not Deploy Publicly"
- Explicit warnings about never using real passwords
- Recommendations to use password managers
- Explanations of ethical hacking principles
- Guidance on responsible disclosure

## üìù Optional Server Implementation

If you want to add actual server-side API endpoints (for `/api-demo`), here's a minimal Express example:

```javascript
// server.js (optional - not required for current implementation)
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Educational demo endpoint - deliberately vulnerable
app.get('/api-demo', (req, res) => {
  // WARNING: This is intentionally insecure for educational purposes
  if (req.query.admin === 'true') {
    res.json({
      status: 200,
      message: 'Admin access granted!',
      flag: 'CTF{insecure_api_parameter_bypass}'
    });
  } else {
    res.status(401).json({
      status: 401,
      message: 'Unauthorized - Admin access required'
    });
  }
});

app.listen(3001, () => {
  console.log('Demo API running on http://localhost:3001');
});
```

**Note:** The current implementation uses client-side simulation, so this server code is optional.
